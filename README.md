# Community Diep (cDiep) server

This is a version of the popular browser game diep.io that was created by the community in [/r/Diepio](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diepio/). Massive credit goes to:

- Nylon/ClearlyCoder for creation of the game and mostly all of the equations
- [/u/Koulatko](https://www.reddit.com/u/Koulatko) for the functions used to render tanks, grids, and more
- [/u/haykam821](https://www.reddit.com/u/haykam821) for both back-end and front-end development

This game is still being worked on, but not as actively as before due to prolonged downtime and other distractions.

The game implements many features not found in the original, including a lot of new tanks, changes to existing tanks (buffs and nerfs), and an advanced server selection system.

## Installation

In order to install the server, you must first have Node.js and `npm` installed, obviously. Then, follow these steps:

* Download the latest release of the server (or latest commit for devs).
* Extract it to a folder.
* Open your command prompt with the working directory being the extracted folder.
* Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
* Run the server (`app.js`) with Node.js.
